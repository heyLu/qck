# qck - type something, find something (quick)!

`qck` is a local metasearch tool that tries to help you find things quickly.

## History

This grew out of experimenting with SDL, first [in C][C] and then [using Zig][Zig].

[Zig]: https://github.com/heyLu/lp/blob/main/zig/sdl

It is very similar to my previous [quickdoc][] project, only standalone and expanded.
